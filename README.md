# Maternal Health Risk Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains information collected from hospitals, community clinics, and maternal healthcare centers through an IoT-based risk monitoring system. It is designed to analyze and predict maternal health risk levels during pregnancy based on key health attributes.

## Data Description
| Feature        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Age            | Age in years when a woman is pregnant.                                      |
| SystolicBP     | Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, an important indicator in pregnancy. |
| DiastolicBP    | Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, also significant during pregnancy.   |
| BS             | Blood glucose levels in mmol/L.                                             |
| HeartRate      | Resting heart rate in beats per minute.                                     |
| RiskLevel      | Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy based on other attributes.  |
